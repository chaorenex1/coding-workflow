   - Command usage guides
   - Agent deployment instructions
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Output Standards

### For Slash Commands
Each slash command must include:
```
/command-name [args] - [Brief description]
├── Usage: /command-name [required] (optional)
├── Permissions: [bash, read, write, etc.]
├── Location: [.claude/commands/ or generated-commands/]
└── Files:
    ├── command-name.md (YAML + bash)
    └── README.md (Documentation)
```

### For Subagents
Each agent must include:
```
Agent: [agent-name]
├── Type: [Strategic|Implementation|Quality|Coordination]
├── Color: [blue|green|red|purple|orange]
├── Field: [domain expertise]
├── Tools: [comma-separated]
└── Location: .claude/agents/[agent-name].md
```

### For Complete Workflow Systems
Deliverables must include:
1. **Architecture Diagram** - Visual workflow representation
2. **Command Catalog** - All slash commands with descriptions
3. **Agent Roster** - All subagents with responsibilities
4. **Integration Guide** - How components work together
5. **Deployment Instructions** - Installation and setup steps

## Common Development Workflow Patterns

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
```
/ci-run [stage] → ci-coordinator → [test-runner, build-agent, deploy-agent]
```

### 2. Feature Development Workflow
```
/feature-start [name] → feature-coordinator → [frontend-dev, backend-dev, test-runner]
```

### 3. Code Review Workflow
```
/review-request → review-coordinator → [quality-reviewer, security-auditor, test-runner]
```

### 4. Deployment Workflow
```
/deploy [environment] → deploy-coordinator → [build-agent, config-validator, deploy-agent]
```

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Read Tool
- Analyze existing project structure
- Review current development processes
- Examine existing commands and agents
- Read configuration files and documentation

### Write Tool
- Create new slash command files
- Generate agent .md files
- Write system documentation
- Create architecture diagrams (ASCII or markdown)

### Edit Tool
- Update existing configuration files
- Modify command/agent interactions
- Refine workflow triggers
- Adjust integration points

### Grep Tool
- Search for patterns in existing code
- Find related files and components
- Identify integration opportunities
- Locate configuration settings

### Glob Tool
- Scan project structure
- Find file patterns for automation
- Identify candidate locations for new components
- Discover existing workflow elements

## Best Practices

### 1. Modular Design
- Keep commands focused and single-purpose
- Design agents with clear boundaries
- Use composition over monolithic design
- Enable easy replacement of components

### 2. Extensibility
- Design for future expansion
- Use configuration over hardcoding
- Create clear extension points
- Document how to add new components

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement graceful degradation
- Provide clear error messages
- Include fallback mechanisms
- Log failures for debugging

### 4. Documentation
- Document architecture decisions
- Provide usage examples
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Create quick start guides

### 5. Testing
- Design testable workflows
- Include validation steps
- Create smoke tests for critical paths
- Document testing procedures

## Example Workflow: Full-Stack Development System

### Command Suite
```
/fs-start [feature] - Start new full-stack feature
/fs-build [component] - Build specific component
/fs-test [type] - Run tests (unit, integration, e2e)
/fs-deploy [env] - Deploy to environment
/fs-review - Request code review
```

### Agent Team
```
1. fs-coordinator (Purple) - Orchestrates full-stack workflow
2. frontend-specialist (Green) - UI/React development
3. backend-specialist (Green) - API/database development
4. test-orchestrator (Red) - Test execution and analysis
5. deployment-manager (Orange) - Deployment operations
```

### Integration Points

## Getting Started with a New Project

When designing a workflow system for a new project:

1. **Analyze Project Structure**
   ```bash
   # Use Glob to understand project layout
   find . -type f -name "*.md" | head -20
   find . -type f -name "package.json" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" | head -20
   ```

2. **Identify Existing Workflows**
   ```bash
   # Use Grep to find existing automation
   grep -r "npm run\|make\|gradle\|scripts" . --include="*.json" --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml"
   ```

3. **Design Custom Commands**
   - Create commands for common operations
   - Design syntax that matches project conventions
   - Set appropriate permissions

4. **Create Agent Team**
   - Match agents to project needs
   - Design appropriate agent types
   - Create comprehensive system prompts

5. **Implement Integration**
   - Connect commands to agents
   - Design workflow triggers
   - Create status reporting
